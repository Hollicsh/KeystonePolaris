---

 **Keystone Percentage Helper** is now **Keystone Polaris**, aligning with the Mythic+ Swiss‑army‑knife vision built with the community. **(#68)**<br>

### Why Keystone Polaris?
- **Keystone** → keeps the strong link to Mythic+ dungeons
- **Polaris** (*the North Star*) → stands for guidance and direction, fitting the addon’s goal of helping players navigate and optimize their runs

This won’t change the features you already know; it clarifies the addon’s long‑term identity.
- Your settings are migrated automatically (no action needed).
- If you happen to lose your settings, please report it here.
- **Workaround:** copy `WTF/Account/YourAccountName/SavedVariables/KeystonePercentageHelper.lua` to `KeystonePolaris.lua` (make sure the game is closed), then relaunch.

As I always say: **KPH is my baby, but it’s *our* addon.**

Once again, thanks a lot for the support!  
*Onward to greater challenges, guided by Polaris.*
