## [3.0](https://github.com/ZelionGG/KeystonePolaris/releases/tag/3.0) (2025-10-06)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/ZelionGG/KeystonePolaris/compare/2.0.1...3.0) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/ZelionGG/KeystonePolaris/releases)

## IMPORTANT
 **Keystone Percentage Helper** is now **Keystone Polaris**, aligning with the Mythic+ Swiss‑army‑knife vision built with the community. **(#68)**<br>

### Why Keystone Polaris?
- **Keystone** → keeps the strong link to Mythic+ dungeons
- **Polaris** (*the North Star*) → stands for guidance and direction, fitting the addon’s goal of helping players navigate and optimize their runs

This won’t change the features you already know; it clarifies the addon’s long‑term identity.
- Your settings are migrated automatically (no action needed).
- If you happen to lose your settings, please report it here.
- **Workaround:** copy `WTF/Account/YourAccountName/SavedVariables/KeystonePercentageHelper.lua` to `KeystonePolaris.lua` (make sure the game is closed), then relaunch.

As I always say: **KPH is my baby, but it’s *our* addon.**

Once again, thanks a lot for the support!  
*Onward to greater challenges, guided by Polaris.*

## NEW

 - Introducing a unified display with optional **Total required for section**, **Current percentage** and **Pull percentage** (Requires MDT), projected values (parentheses) in combat for Required/Current, per-line completion suffixes, configurable layout (single-line or multi-line), and a switch between **percentage** and **count-based** modes. **(#40, #69)**
 - Introducing **Test Mode**, a new feature that allows you to simulate multiple Mythic+ situations (out-of-fight section in progress, pull in progress with a section in progress, section percentage done, ...). **(#71)**
 - Introducing **Changelog Translation**, a new feature that allows you to translate the changelog into your language by copying it from a popup and pasting it into your translator tool.

## IMPROVEMENT

- Russian translation updated, thank you **Hollicsh**.
