## IMPORTANT

- Moved back to a single addon format (deleted the old **KeystonePercentageHelper** compatibility addon). If you lost your settings, you can get them back by renaming the **KeystonePercentageHelper.lua** file in your **[WTF/Account/YourAccountName/SavedVariables]** folder to **KeystonePolaris.lua** (close the game before doing that).
